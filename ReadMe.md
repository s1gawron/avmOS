# Abstract Virtual Machine Operating System

### This project was inspired by [Scott Hanselman TinyOS](https://github.com/shanselman/TinyOS) final project for Operating Systems classes.

For this project I got the idea by looking at GitHub profiles of people I follow. Looking at TinyOS by Scott I thought it would cool, interesting and very useful to learn how operating systems work. 
Most developers nowadays work on high level abstractions while creating software and do not care about what is happening inside their computer. In my opinion if you are a software developer, you should still know the basics of how computers work!

This project should allow me to better understand the software that I am writing. The work I will be doing here will not be just a copy-paste of Scott's project, but I will try to get as much knowledge about operating systems as I can.
I will start my research in [Gynvael's book "ZrozumieÄ‡ programowanie"](https://github.com/gynvael) (unluckily this book is only in Polish) in which he describes a lot of interesting Computer Science related topics and then move on to other sources where I can get some knowledge.

The requirements for this project are either in this repository [Scotts_OriginalAssignment.md](Scotts_OriginalAssignment.md) as a backup or in Scott's TinyOS repository.
